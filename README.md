# Awesome Steam Deck

*ðŸš§ Under construction ðŸš§*

This is a curation of useful resources on Steam Deck.

## Steam Artworks
Steam artworks aren't a requirement for a game to function, Steam library allows artworks to be configured with both Steam game and Non-Steam games. This makes the library more beautiful, personalised and more user-friendly. Im general, five types are needed: namely, poster (portrait), banner (landscape), logo, icon and hero (background). SteamGridDB is a common site for that.

## Proton
Proton is a compatibility layer for Microsoft Windows games to run on Linux-based operating systems. SteamOS comes with a version of Proton by default. In general, the latest version tends to have a larger list of compatible games and the default Proton version may not be the latest. [ProtonUp-QT](https://davidotek.github.io/protonup-qt/) is an App to manage Proton versions. After a version is installed, it will be accessible by Steam, Lutris, Heroic game launcher, etc
